    Initial code release for CC-Lib for CHAABI support

    BZ:21025

    This CC-Lib code is based on the alpha release from Discretix.
    The flag "BUILD_WITH_CHAABI_SUPPORT" in the BoardConifig.mk file is set to "false"
    to enable the compilation as the Chaabi hardware support is not yet available.
